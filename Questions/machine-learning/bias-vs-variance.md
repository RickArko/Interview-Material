# Bias vs. Variance:
Understanding bias and variance, which have roots in statistics, is essential for data scientists involved in machine learning. Bias and variance are used in supervised machine learning, in which an algorithm learns from training data or a sample data set of known quantities. The correct balance of bias and variance is vital to building machine-learning algorithms that create accurate results from their models.

## Bias
The amount a model's prediction differs from the target value, compared to the training data.


## Variance
Describes how much a random variable differs from its expected value.


## Summary
When building a supervised machine-learning algorithm, the goal is to achieve low bias and variance for the most accurate predictions. Data scientists must do this while keeping underfitting and overfittingExternal link:open_in_new in mind. A model that exhibits small variance and high bias will underfit the target, while a model with high variance and little bias will overfit the target.
