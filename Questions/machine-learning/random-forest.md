# Random Forest

In essence, the random forest algorithm is an ensemble learning algorithm that makes predictions by using multiple decision trees instead of one. By doing so, it’s able to make decisions based on a “majority-wins” system, treating each decision tree as an individual voter.

The pros of this are that it makes it much more accurate than a decision tree because it’s less prone to the risk of error that one tree would make by itself. As a consequence, it also makes it less biased and reduces the variability of the model.

The downside to this model is that it’s not as intuitive to understand how the model gets to the output, making it seem like a “black box” model.
