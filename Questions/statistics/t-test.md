# T-Test

## Hypothesis test:

- **Null Hypothesis:** Nothing interesting about the variables you are testing. 
    - Examples:
        - these is nothing different between my sample group and the population

- Alternative Hypothesis:





## One Sample T-Test
Test whether a sample mean differs from the population mean

**example:**
```
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    ...
    ...
    
    stats.ttest_1samp(a = sample, popmean=population.mean())
```
