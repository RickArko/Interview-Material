# Linear Regression:


$$
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \epsilon_i
$$
	
## Assumptions:

1. (L) Linear Correlation between Predictor and Regressors 	 			(CRITICAL)
1. (I) Residuals are Idependent (statistical independence of errors)    (NICE)
1. (N) Residuals are Normally Distributed								(NICE TO HAVE)
1. (E) Residuals have constant variance (Homoskedasticity)
